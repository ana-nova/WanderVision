# WanderVision

## Description

The WanderVision is a simple travel planning application. It allows users to:

- Create new trip entries with details like destination, fun facts, time slots, and transportation options.
- Organize trips into favorites and filter them using a search bar.
- Edit or delete trip entries as needed.
- Fetch and display trip-related data from external APIs to enhance entries.
- Persist data using local storage or a backend, so trip entries are saved between sessions.
